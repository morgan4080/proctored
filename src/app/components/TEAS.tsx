                            </dt>

                            <dd className="inline">The Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS Test) is a key standardized, multiple-choice entrance exam for all applicants to nursing and other health programs across the United States. Administered by the Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI), it is a critical tool for evaluating candidates for nursing or allied health programs. The TEAS exam offers flexibility in its administration, with students having the option to take it at educational institutions, designated testing centers, or remotely through ATI.



                                Since its inception in 1999, the TEAS has undergone several revisions to stay current with educational curricula. The latest version, ATI TEAS 7, launched in June 2022, maintains the same standard as its predecessor, ATI TEAS 6, but includes important updates. These changes involve modifying the number of questions in each section, including alternate item format questions, and applying contemporary educational standards. These updates ensure that the exam remains a relevant and effective tool for assessing your readiness for a nursing or allied health career.

                            </dt>

                            <dd className="inline">The length of the TEAS exam is 209 minutes. It includes 170 questions, with 150 scored and 20 unscored. The material is taken from an all-inclusive TEAS Test Bank, including thousands of questions from every chapter tested. The four main portions of the TEAS examination are Reading, Mathematics, Science, and English Language and Usage.



                                The exam has forty-five items in the reading section to test candidates ability to read and understand passages and visual data. Knowledge in algebra, measurements, and data application constitutes the 38-item mathematics section. The science section, which consists of 50 items, covers human biology, life science, and physical science. This section concerns the English language and usage, with 37 items testing grammar and spelling.



                                The most important change in ATI TEAS Version 7 is the addition of a subcategory called Chemistry and Biology to the Science section. This change is not just an update but a reassurance that the examination is evolving with the times, keeping pace with changes in healthcare education. As you prepare to take the TEAS Proctored Exam, rest assured that your understanding of these areas is not just for the exam but also a valuable asset for your future career in nursing and other health-related fields
