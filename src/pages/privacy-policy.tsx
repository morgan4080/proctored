        <p>Exercising the CCPA Data Protection Rights</p>
        <p>
          As a California resident, you can exercise your CCP right, and to do
          so, contact us with the details shared in the last section below. In
          case you are an authorised agent submitting the request on behalf of a
          consumer, you should have a copy of the written authorisation signed
          by a particular consumer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving your request, we will verify your identity to
          determine if you are the same person on whom we have all the necessary
          information in our system. To verify, we will ask you certain
          questions or request you to provide certain information that matches
          your previous information shared with us. For example, we may ask you
          for information we already have, like your phone or email address. If
          required, we may use another verification process to determine your
          identity or authority to make a request. If you cannot verify the
          primary identification information, we may ask for more safety and
          fraud prevention information. We will delete all the additional
          information after the verification.

        <p>US Penalties</p>
        <p>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</p>
        <p>
          Violating the CCPA can bring civil penalties of up to $7,500 for every
          violation. In case of willful violation, $2,500 per violation, while
          for advertent violation after notice, 30 days are offered to find a
          cure. A user can seek statutory damage of $100 and not more than $750
          per consumer in every occurrence, or actual damages, whichever is
          greater, brought by them for violating security breach.
        </p>
        <p>VCDPA (Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act)</p>
        <p>
          If the processor continues to violate the VCDPA forms after 30 days of
          the cure period, or if the professor fails to comply with a written
          statement by the Attorney General, the Attorney General will announce
          action on behalf of the Commonwealth. S/he will seek an injunction to
          prevent VCDPA violations and a civil penalty close to $7,500.
        </p>
        <p>CPA (Colorado Privacy Act)</p>
        <p>
          According to the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, a violation is an
          act of deceptive trade practice. Even though the CPA does not have a
          fixed penalty amount, the Colorado Consumer Protection Act does and
          stipulates a penalty of $20,000 per violation.
        </p>
        <p>UCPA (Utah Consumer Privacy Act)</p>
        <p>
          Under UNPA, the Attorney General has enforcement responsibilities, and
          the entities must be informed in writing of the suspected violations
          and given 30 days to correct them. They can file a lawsuit for uncured
          offences and seek damages and civil fines of $7,500 from the consumer
          for every violation. Even though there’s no private right of action,
          the local privacy laws are preempted based on stature.

          aims to promote and protect individual privacy by giving effect to
          international privacy standards and providing a framework for ensuring
          security for personal data, including your access to information and
          practising other rights and interests. There are 13 privacy principles

        <p>
          Penalties in New Zealand for the unregulated collection of personal

        <p>
          Under South African law, cybercrimes are treated as a criminal
          offence. The Act mandates everyone to clearly understand the
          regulations before prosecuting them. Cyber extortion, cyber fraud,
          malicious communication, and unlawful access to the computer system
          are some of the cybercrimes listed in this Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, unregulated collection of personal data that is collected
          by violating the applicable law can invite the following penalties:

        <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>

          The amount of the fine is from EUR 10,000 to EUR 520,000 in the
          equivalent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, from February 1st, 2022, data collection can begin only
          after obtaining the appropriate permission from the owner of such
          data. Therefore, it is necessary to install a pop-up on the site that
          will appear when entering from the territory of South Africa, which
          will request permission to collect and process and only after that let

          sincere effort to protect your personal information, no storage
          technology can guarantee complete security, so we won’t make
          unrealistic promises stating no hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorised parties can break into our security system to collect,
          steal, access, modify your data. We do our best to protect your
          information from unsafe sources. Still, transmitting your data to and
          from our services should be at your own risk. You should only access
          our services and products within a safe environment.

        <p>Data collection from minors</p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect information or market our products and
          services to children under 18. When you use our services or products,
          we assume that you are 18 years of age or a guardian of a minor and
          consent to use our services. If we learn that a user is less than 18,
          the account is immediately deactivated, and we take the necessary
          measures to delete their personal data from our systems. If you know
          someone below 18 availing of our services or products, please notify
          us at{' '}

        <p>Do-not-track features</p>
        <p>
          Countless web browsers and many mobile operating systems and
          applications include a Do-not-track (DNT) feature in the system so the
          user can activate the signal according to their preference and not
          worry about being monitored or data processing. However, no standard
          technology has been finalised for recognising and implementing DNT
          signals on a larger scale. Due to this, we do not respond to DNT
          browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate
          your preference. Despite so, if we adopt a standard for online
          tracking in the future, we will inform you about the practice and
          include it in our revised version of our privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>Cross-Border Transfers</p>
        <p>
          We process your personal information both within and outside the
          country. Each country has different data processing laws, and we
          ensure we abide by legal measures to assure high privacy compliance.
        </p>
        <p>Time for Reply and Solution</p>
        <p>
          We will provide you with the necessary information and take action on
          your request related to your rights within one month of receiving the
          request. The duration is likely to increase by 15 more days in case of
          an overwhelming number of requests, complicated requests, or requests
          that require extensive action. Regardless, we will inform you
          beforehand of such an extension within one month of receiving the
          request and the reason for such delay.
        </p>
        <p>Account Assessment for Customer Support</p>
        <p>
          In special instances, like getting customer support, our support team
          may request your account access. In such circumstances, they will be
          able to see your personal data in your account. Please note that we
          always take users’ permission before accessing their accounts.
          However, if you don’t permit access, it will delay the process and
          affect the customer support provisions.
        </p>
        <p>Notifications of Breach</p>

          there&apos;s no obligation. Yet, personal information is necessary for
          creating a user account and availing of our services or using our
          products. If you refuse you provide information, you will be less
          likely to get access to all our service features.

          In case of a data breach, we will keep you informed. We will notify
          the respective data protection agency without delay to minimise the
          possibility of high violations of your rights and data safety. We take
          the best measures to avert such risks.
